    <h1>Pumping Water Uphill to Change Lives</h1>
    <p>A powerful community initiative that brings clean, reliable water to areas where natural sources lie below the homes and farms. By using sustainable pumping systems, this effort reduces the daily struggle of fetching water, especially for women and children, improves public health by providing safer water, and boosts local agriculture through better irrigation. This simple act not only enhances quality of life but also empowers communities to grow stronger, healthier, and more resilient for the future.</p>

      <h2>CO-FOUNDER & CEO</h2>
      <h1>AUKE IDZENGA</h1>

      <p>
        Auke Idzenga is a Dutch marine engineer who transitioned from a career at sea having served aboard three different vessels to a life of service in the Philippines, where he has been at the forefront of renewable energy initiatives for underserved communities. His early work included six years in an agricultural program supporting sugar workers, laying the groundwork for his lifelong commitment to social development.In 1992, he co-founded the Alternative Indigenous Development Foundation, Inc. (AIDFI) and pioneered the introduction of hydraulic ram pump technology then largely unknown in the region. Under his leadership, AIDFI developed a distinctive, sustainable approach to this technology, which has since been implemented in numerous communities across the Philippines and internationally.Mr. Idzenga has undergone extensive training in both technical and project management fields. His work has been widely recognized: in 2011, he accepted the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award on behalf of AIDFI, and in 2019, he was personally honored with the Saint Teresa of Calcutta Award, recognizing him as an "Engineer for the Poor."Despite his achievements, Auke maintains a humble lifestyle. He finds joy in simple pleasures such as roasting his own beans and savoring native coffee, often accompanied by a cigar—a testament to his grounded and reflective character.

  <h2>Our Work</h2>
<div class="work-items">
  <div class="work-item">
    <h3>Hydraulic Ram Pumps</h3>
    <img src="images/ramp.jpg" alt="Child drinking clean water" class="about-img" loading="lazy">
    <p>
      We utilize innovative hydraulic ram pump technology that operates without electricity or fuel, using only the kinetic energy of flowing water. This eco-friendly solution is ideal for off-grid and mountainous areas, delivering water to higher elevations for domestic use, irrigation, and livestock. With minimal maintenance and zero operating costs, our pumps provide a sustainable and reliable water supply to remote communities year-round.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="work-item">
    <h3>Water Systems Installation</h3>
    <img src="images/waterins.jpg" alt="Child drinking clean water" class="about-img" loading="lazy">
    <p>
      We design and implement customized water distribution systems tailored to the specific needs of each community. These systems include pipelines, water tanks, and tap stands that ensure clean, safe, and consistent water delivery to homes, farms, and communal facilities. Our installations are built to last and are designed with ease of maintenance in mind, helping improve health, hygiene, and agricultural productivity.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="work-item">
    <h3>Community Training</h3>
    <img src="images/training.jpg" alt="Child drinking clean water" class="about-img" loading="lazy">
    <p>
      Beyond infrastructure, we focus on empowering communities through hands-on training and capacity building. Our programs cover the maintenance and repair of water systems, water conservation practices, and community led management strategies. This ensures long-term sustainability, local ownership, and resilience, enabling communities to take charge of their water resources and secure their future.

      <h3>Ram Pump Program</h3>
      <img src="images/rprog.png" alt="Hydraulic ram pump system" class="program-img" loading="lazy">
      <p>
        AIDFI’s water system project begins with a 3-5 day survey involving local community members, officials, and coordinators to plan and produce a technical study with project costs for funders. Social preparation follows, establishing a registered water association and training its officers in management and skills. Prefabricated materials are prepared in AIDFI’s workshop while installation takes place over 30 to 120 days, involving local labor and communal “Bayanihan” activities, alongside ongoing training and technology transfer. Monitoring ensures quality during construction, leading to a final inspection before the formal conveyance of the system to the water association, recognizing stakeholders and providing official documentation. Six months after turnover, post-project assessment and continuous monitoring with a mobile app help track water delivery and project impact.

    <!-- Essential Oil Program -->
    <div class="program-item">
      <h3>Essential Oil Program</h3>
      <img src="images/eop.png" alt="Essential oil distillation equipment" class="program-img" loading="lazy">
      <p>
        AIDFI’s Essential Oil Program, launched in the early 2000s, evolved from its agricultural and technology development efforts into a flagship social enterprise focused on producing essential oil from lemongrass to provide livelihood opportunities for small upland farmers. Starting with a pilot project in Brgy. Mambugsay, Cauayan, Negros Occidental, AIDFI developed a unique steam distillery and helped organize farmers into the Mambugsay Essential Oil Producers Association (MEOPA), providing technical, organizational, and marketing support. Over time, decentralized small-scale factories were built in 2013 with support from the Japanese Embassy and in 2020 funded by the Australian Embassy and Dutch partners significantly improving production efficiency and industry standards. The community currently produces around 30 liters monthly with plans to expand capacity and transition to solar-powered operations to enhance sustainability and reduce reliance on firewood.

  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <img src="images/kid.png" alt="Child drinking clean water" class="about-img" loading="lazy">
  <p>
      Since our founding in 1991, the Alternative Indigenous Development Foundation (AIDFI) has been dedicated to working closely with the most marginalized and poorest rural communities, primarily in Bacolod City and surrounding areas in the Philippines. As a non-government organization, we believe that meaningful progress begins at the grassroots level—where people’s lives are directly impacted by the challenges of poverty, limited access to resources, and environmental vulnerability.Our approach is holistic and community-centered. We introduce appropriate technologies that are environmentally sound and culturally relevant, helping communities to improve their livelihoods without compromising the health of the ecosystems they depend on. We also support the growth of social enterprises, empowering local people to build sustainable businesses that generate income and build resilience.At AIDFI, community development goes beyond economic gains. We foster social inclusion, education, and capacity-building to ensure that every member of the community has a voice and the tools to participate in shaping their future.We envision a world where technology and development harmonize with nature a future where communities thrive in peace, freedom, and fairness. Our commitment is to promote sustainable growth that is shared equitably, leaving no one behind and preserving the environment for generations to come.Through decades of partnership, innovation, and advocacy, AIDFI continues to be a catalyst for positive change, building empowered, self-reliant communities that are prepared to face the challenges of today and tomorrow.
